# Sandhill API Reference
This document provides a full API reference for Sandhill code not
covered by user-facing documentation. If you plan on developing
additional data processors, filters, or the like, this may be
useful. Otherwise, you can safely ignore these documentation pages.

## Routes
Core routing API should not be needed even when developing new
functionality for your instance. Still, it's provided here for
the curious.
